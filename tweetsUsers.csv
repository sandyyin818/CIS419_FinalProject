"HillaryClinton","There was a 10-point increase in youth turnout from 2014 to 2018, due in part to the hard work done by @Alliance4Youth. More than 30% of young people voted in 2018! In Chicago, young people outperformed all other generations on Election Day for the first time ever."
"HillaryClinton","Five @EmergeAmerica alumni are headed to Congress, and 145 were elected to state legislatures. Emerge alums also helped put an end to the Republican supermajorities in the Michigan and Pennsylvania senates."
"HillaryClinton","For many campaigns, @SwingLeft was the wave. On average, for their top 15 campaigns, Swing Left drove more than 50% of their canvassing shifts. More than 60,000 volunteers knocked an estimated 5 million doors and made 2.5 million phone calls."
"HillaryClinton","In 2018, @LatinoVictoryUS increased their endorsed candidates 500% over the previous year. Of their 58 candidates, 43 candidates won, bringing their 2018 win rate to a whopping 74%. The number of Democratic Latina members of Congress nearly doubled."

"HillaryClinton",".@ArenaSummit supported 54 candidates in the 2018 election cycle, and 27 of their candidates on the ballot won their elections. Their 2018 New York candidates went 7 for 9—ensuring Democrats defeated the IDC, took back the N.Y. State Senate, and won a majority in the U.S. House."
"HillaryClinton",".@VotoLatino registered thousands of voters through online digital ads and targeting, peer-to-peer outreach through their local chapters, and national partner engagement. In Texas, where Voto Latino has had a program since 2010, early votes surpassed 2014 totals by 149%."
"HillaryClinton",".@ColorOfChange PAC’s #VotingWhileBlack program reached more than 5 million voters, and now African Americans have a new cohort of officeholders at both the local and state level."

"HillaryClinton","Actions have consequences, and whether we’re in Syria or not, the people who want to harm us are there &amp; at war. Isolationism is weakness. Empowering ISIS is dangerous. Playing into Russia &amp; Iran’s hands is foolish. This President is putting our national security at grave risk."
"HillaryClinton","Winning back the House was a pipe dream a year ago. @IndivisibleTeam, an @OnwardTogether partner, helped win 40 seats. Now they're going on offense in the House and building power in the states. Read their roadmap for the next two years: https://t.co/oci7KWygwW"

"HillaryClinton","This is not in line with American values, and it’s a dangerous path. It's a fundamental building block of democracy that elected representatives respect the outcome of elections. To ignore those outcomes is to silence voters and endanger the health of our democracy itself."
"HillaryClinton","In Michigan, voters chose Democrats to be governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Since then, the Republican-controlled legislature has passed bills to gut minimum wage, slash paid sick leave, and limit the new secretary of state's powers. https://t.co/P979PIvCrY"
"HillaryClinton","Over the last few days, Republicans in Wisconsin's state legislature have pushed through bills to shift power to their Republican-controlled legislature and away from the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. https://t.co/V7pUkwpujH"
"HillaryClinton","Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin lost elections on Nov. 6. Rather than respect the will of voters, they're using their last few weeks in office to pass laws limiting the power of new governors and put roadblocks on voting. It's not just anti-Democratic. It's anti-democratic."
"HillaryClinton","Russia's actions brazenly violate a treaty allowing free passage in the strait and the G7 should hold fast in demanding the sailors' immediate return."

"HillaryClinton","Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: ""Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?"" He said he was not. Because there are none."
"HillaryClinton","Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. It's an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society."
"HillaryClinton","When Kavanaugh called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs,"" he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn't the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh didn't use that term because he misunderstands the basic  science of birth control—the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because it's a dog whistle to the extreme right."
"HillaryClinton","I want to be sure we're all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as ""abortion-inducing drugs."" That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too."

"HillaryClinton","In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a ""thin statute"" to support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants."
"HillaryClinton","During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases."
"HillaryClinton","Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years—maybe decades—that we can’t afford to waste on inaction."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were ""well within"" the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up."

"HillaryClinton","The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaugh's record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression."
"HillaryClinton","Voter fraud—the justification for voter ID laws—has also been proven to be a virtually nonexistent problem. A recent Brennan Center report noted that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at the polls. https://t.co/gW9sf5QNRB"
"HillaryClinton","He wrote approvingly of ""recent changes to voting laws"" that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters."
"HillaryClinton","Today's reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots."

"HillaryClinton","One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about one's own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures."
"HillaryClinton","It's remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights."
"HillaryClinton","Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a woman's right to make her own health decisions."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control."
"HillaryClinton","As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion."
"HillaryClinton","A few weeks before Kavanaugh's name appeared on President Trump's short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his “hero,” noting that “he clearly wanted to overrule Roe.”"
"HillaryClinton","If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will."
"HillaryClinton","This is as serious as it gets. It's up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans—again. 

As Kavanaugh's hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: (202) 224-3121"
"HillaryClinton","Supreme Court seats are for life. Your senators' votes on Kavanaugh could affect whether you, your loved ones, and millions of other Americans can get affordable health care for decades."
"HillaryClinton","Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not to implement the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans in the lurch."
"HillaryClinton","In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier."
"HillaryClinton","The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaugh’s record shows he’d be a threat to the law."
"HillaryClinton","Challenges to the Affordable Care Act's protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies can't refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts."
"HillaryClinton","Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you care about someone who has one? Could you or someone you love ever get one? 

Then you should call your senators today to #StopKavanaugh from getting a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. Here's why: https://t.co/zgqwfdwTsF"
"HillaryClinton","Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day. 

We can't afford more damage to workers' rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Let's #StopKavanaugh."
"HillaryClinton","In 2016, Kavanaugh held that corporations have the right to punish workers for displaying pro-union signs in their cars."
"HillaryClinton","In 2014, he dissented in a case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death of a trainer."
"HillaryClinton","In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers' ability to bargain collectively."
"HillaryClinton","In other words, the Court has already been widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers. Kavanaugh's record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows he'd help further that trend for a generation."
"HillaryClinton","The Court has also recently granted corporations the right to deny workers reproductive health care and made it harder for workers to sue businesses by allowing companies to force employees to sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts."
"HillaryClinton","That ruling won't just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. It'll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too."
"HillaryClinton","The Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts don't have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if they're not members."
"HillaryClinton","The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people."
"HillaryClinton","Happy Labor Day. There's no better time to talk about why workers’ rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed."

"realDonaldTrump","The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don’t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!"
"realDonaldTrump","We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem."
"realDonaldTrump","I don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?"
"realDonaldTrump","Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama &amp; the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine &amp; settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!"
"realDonaldTrump","The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!"
"realDonaldTrump","Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!"

"realDonaldTrump","As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020, too much success!"

"realDonaldTrump","For those that naively ask why didn’t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us “NONE” for Border Security!

"realDonaldTrump","The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall."
"realDonaldTrump","The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting &amp; expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a U.S. record!"

"realDonaldTrump",".....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they don’t. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!"
"realDonaldTrump","The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else’s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It’s like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, &amp; technology....."
"realDonaldTrump","Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes, but as shown in the House, good things happen. If enough Dems don’t vote, it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!"
"realDonaldTrump","Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didn’t have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won, 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!"
"realDonaldTrump","Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!"

This is a long and historic commitment, &amp; one that is absolutely vital to America’s national security.” @SecPompeo  I agree 100%. In addition, many Billions of Dollars of purchases made in U.S., big Jobs &amp; Oil!"

"realDonaldTrump","“79% of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit.” @FoxNews  A terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace. It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays. Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits. Too big!"
"realDonaldTrump","There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger. Not good!"

"realDonaldTrump",".....are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!"
"realDonaldTrump","Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have “Obama judges,” and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an “independent judiciary,” but if it is why......"

"realDonaldTrump","....We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That’s ENDING!"
"realDonaldTrump","Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars &amp; they never told us he was living there. Fools!.."

"realDonaldTrump","Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away. Dems must approve Border Security &amp; Wall NOW!"
"realDonaldTrump","The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that “the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months.” Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!"

"realDonaldTrump","Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page &amp; her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side?"
"realDonaldTrump","....care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won’t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!"
"realDonaldTrump","The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts.

"realDonaldTrump","On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!"
"realDonaldTrump","Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One &amp; Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!"

"realDonaldTrump","Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him “back into play.” Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he’s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!"
"realDonaldTrump","Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they “found” many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. “The Broward Effect.” How come they never find Republican votes?"
"realDonaldTrump","Jeff Flake(y) doesn’t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the “crime” of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!"

"realDonaldTrump","I’m in @Omarosa’s book on page 149. She claims to have heard from someone who heard from me that I heard Trump use the N-word.

Not only is this flat-out false (I’ve never heard such a thing), but Omarosa didn’t even make an effort to call or email me to verify. Very shoddy work."
"realDonaldTrump","LTo the many dozens of #journalists who called me, questioning @OMAROSA claim in her new book that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump took a note from me, put it in his mouth and ate it...I saw NO such thing and am shocked anyone would take this seriously."
"realDonaldTrump","Brooks Koepka just won his third Golf Major, and he did it not only with his powerful game, but with his powerful mind. He has been a man of steel on the Tour and will have many Victories, including Majors, ahead of him. Congrats to Brooks and his great team on a job well done!"
"realDonaldTrump","Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!"
"realDonaldTrump","Just fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!"
"realDonaldTrump","Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!"
"realDonaldTrump","The very unpopular Governor of Ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @JohnKasich hurt Troy Balderson’s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. Even Kasich’s Lt. Governor lost Gov. race because of his unpopularity. Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN!"
"realDonaldTrump","While I know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!"
"realDonaldTrump","...really bad things. Nasty to people &amp; would constantly miss meetings &amp; work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser &amp; nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!"
"realDonaldTrump","Wacky Omarosa, who got fired 3 times on the Apprentice, now got fired for the last time. She never made it, never will. She begged me for a job, tears in her eyes, I said Ok. People in the White House hated her. She was vicious, but not smart. I would rarely see her but heard...."

"realDonaldTrump","The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele’s many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony &amp; discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary &amp; the DNC...."

"realDonaldTrump","Why isn’t the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages  to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won’t give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people....."
"realDonaldTrump","Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman. Canada must wait. Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can’t make a deal!"

"realDonaldTrump","I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"
"realDonaldTrump",".....Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!"
"realDonaldTrump","The NFL players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem. Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their “outrage” at something that most of them are unable to define. They make a fortune doing what they love......"

"realDonaldTrump","@LindseyGrahamSC  “Why didn’t the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page? Is there a double standard here?” They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump. Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY?"

Sorry, we can’t let that happen! Also, change the rules in the Senate and approve STRONG Border Security!"

"realDonaldTrump","Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!"
"realDonaldTrump","..Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. At minimum, we will make much better Trade Deals for our country!"
"realDonaldTrump","Tariffs are working big time. Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come,Tax them. If they don’t want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event, it means jobs and great wealth....."
"realDonaldTrump","The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it’s TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People.

"realDonaldTrump","....Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. Only fools would disagree. We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and, if countries are still unwilling to negotiate, they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs. We win either way......"
"realDonaldTrump","....Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry. Plants are opening all over the U.S., Steelworkers are working again, and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury. Other countries use Tariffs against, but when we use them, foolish people scream!"

https://t.co/FLIibhbIBl"
"AnnCoulter","@RyanGirdusky @westland_will The plane is crashing with no survivors. Trump surrounded himself with snakes and traitors instead of MAGA loyalists."
"AnnCoulter","Any candidate going into 2020 needs to understand this issue. It's about time the GOP base understands why their party is failing them so miserably on their most important issue."
"AnnCoulter","Lastly the problem w/ Trump supporters is they're unwillingness to criticize their guy. I get it, he's our quarterback, don't boo him, he's trying... I'm sorry but no. He's caved a lot. With Texas going blue in 10 yrs. or less we don't need cheerleaders we need leaders"
"AnnCoulter","Even worse, the judiciary (namely the 9th circuit) are giving away constitutional rights to illegals like they're candy. We are going to have defacto amensty because of our judges and there's no pushback from Congress or the WH"
"AnnCoulter","So without a competent staff - No Kris Kobach, No Mickey Kaus, No John Miano... the admin didn't push for immigration reform, for a wall, to even whip the votes for Congress to support the emergency declaration."
"AnnCoulter","No one was worse at putting bad personnel in places than Johnny DeStefano... use to head PPO and brought Never Trumpers into the admin in droves. He now works w/ Kellyanne Conway."
"AnnCoulter","Short's replacement Shahira Knight was pushed by Gen. Kelly, the man who just gloated about how he would have worked for Hillary and how the wall is stupid! (Kelly also got Nielsen appointed to DHS)"
"AnnCoulter","Trump also has a problem w/ his legislative director. First he had Marc Short, a Koch Brothers alum who worked on the Stop Trump campaign in 2016. Short bragged in a politico article how he wasn't pushing Congress to accept any immigration changes Trump campaigned on"
"AnnCoulter","Nielsen is even worse. She has been openly hostile, firing pro-wall MAGA ppl. The State Dept. under Nieslen is worse than Obama's State Dept. Now she has a whisper campaign against Lee Francis Cisna, one of the only good ppl in the admin working on immigration"
"AnnCoulter","Making things worse is the fact that Pompeo has filled State w/ Bush ppl or Obama ppl. An Obama appointee runs our refugee program. Think about that! Mike Pompeo is no friend to the MAGA agenda"
"AnnCoulter","Pompeo has refused to classify the Mexican Drug Cartel as a foreign terrorist organization - a bill Chip Roy sponsored (a great rep!) He has refused to punish Mexico for the opioid crisis. The State Dept. hasn't used their power to fullest to stop both the opioid crisis."
"AnnCoulter","So yes, Congress has been bad, but Trump hasn't done anything to push them.  His administration have been TRULY TERRIBLE.... it bears repeating. TERRIBLE."
"AnnCoulter","This is the view that a majority of Republicans in Congress have... do what the donors ask, we always need more cheap labor. Some of the worst offenders - Sen. Tillis, Sen. Gardner, Sen. Cramer, Rep. Gonzalez, Rep. McCaul, Rep. Stefanik..."

They get turned away at the WH? The Angel Moms! @POTUS brought them onstage over &amp; over again during the campaign &amp; do you remember what he always said to them? I do, it's branded on my soul!:

I will never forget you. https://t.co/BTeiVjkUTo"
"AnnCoulter","A lot of news broke in the last few days off my twitter account about the angel moms and a meeting with Trump about the border bill. I want to clarify how things actually went down:"
"AnnCoulter","Angel moms came to DC early in the week, trying to schedule meetings with Trump, Schumer, and Pelosi. 
Schumer's office granted them a meeting, Pelosi's office called the police on them, but Trump's WH respectfully said they couldn't take a meeting."
"AnnCoulter","According to two sources, the order was coming right from Mulvaney to stop a meeting w/ the angel moms. The WH has ways of stopping info from coming to Trump, many members of the WH team who are hostile to the MAGA movement keep information from ever reaching POTUS' desk"
"AnnCoulter","With Trump in the dark, Angel Families and their organizers brainstormed how to get POTUS' attention. They floated multiple ideas but time was running out with a majority of them having return flights on home scheduled on Thursday"
"AnnCoulter","They decided upon a press conference outside the WH where they would denounce the border bill. The WH caught wind of this and panicked, it would be horrible optics especially given that they had worked so hard trying to stop criticism from conservative media outlets"
"AnnCoulter","Mercedes Schlapp called one of the organizers, asking that they turn around and stated that Trump was fighting for them w/ this bill. The organizer refused to give saying that $1.375 billion wasn't enough for all these dead Americans."
"AnnCoulter","With Mercedes unsuccessful, Kellyanne Conway called saying and also argued that they shouldn't do this to Trump. The fight got heated, words were exchanged, but in the end the Angel Families refused to give up their press conference in front of the White House."
"AnnCoulter","Kellyanne was visibly upset after the conversation, Trump walked in the room and noticed something was wrong. After a week of keeping him in the dark someone relented and told him about the Angel Families."
"AnnCoulter","As the Angel Families rolled near the White House, Trump called the organizer and stated he wanted to meet with them, that he had no idea, and invited them for a meeting at 9:15 AM on Friday."
"AnnCoulter","Most of the Angel Families had left by that point but a few were there. But those that were there were happy to meet Trump. It was Trump's idea to bring them in the rose garden."
"AnnCoulter","One of the more noticeably chatty members of the WH staff was Sylvia Mae Davis, Deputy White House Staff Secretary/ Deputy Assistant to the President, ironically she's one of the most hostile people towards the MAGA movement in the WH."
